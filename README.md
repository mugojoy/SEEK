# Fun Calculator 🎉

A simple and fun calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers. This Python script adds, subtracts, multiplies, and divides two user-provided numbers with style! 😎

## Features ✨

- ➕ Addition
- ➖ Subtraction
- ✖️ Multiplication
- ➗ Division
- Handles decimal numbers (floats)
- Fun and colorful output with emojis!

## How to Use 🚀

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer
2. Run the script in your terminal/command prompt:
   ```
   python fun_calculator.py
   ```
3. Enter your first number when prompted
4. Enter your second number when prompted
5. Marvel at the mathematical results! 🎉

## Example Usage 💻

```
Enter the first number: 10.5
Enter the second number: 2

Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.5
Difference: 8.5
Product: 21.0
Quotient: 5.25
```

## Important Notes ⚠️

- The program doesn't currently handle division by zero (it will crash if you try to divide by 0)
- All inputs are converted to floats, so whole numbers can be entered with or without decimals

## Future Improvements 🔮

- [ ] Add error handling for division by zero
- [ ] Add more operations (exponents, modulus, etc.)
- [ ] Create a graphical user interface (GUI) version
- [ ] Add support for more than two numbers
